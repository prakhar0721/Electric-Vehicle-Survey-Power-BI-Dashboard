# Electric-Vehicle-Survey-Power-BI-Dashboard
‚ö° Electric Vehicle Survey Dashboard - Power BI Project
This project is based on a problem statement related to the adoption and perception of electric vehicles (EVs). I worked on the data collected through a survey and created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key insights.

üîç Project Highlights:
Problem Statement: Understanding consumer behavior, preferences, and concerns regarding electric vehicles.

Power BI Dashboard: Designed a user-friendly, interactive dashboard to explore survey results effectively.

Insights & Conclusions: The dashboard highlights important trends and patterns, helping to draw meaningful conclusions about the adoption of EVs.

Data Handling: Applied ETL operations to clean, transform, and prepare the data for accurate reporting and analysis.

Data Source: Survey data is included in the repository for reference and reproducibility.

üí° Key Features:
Respondent demographics and awareness levels

Preferences for EV brands, features, and pricing

Concerns related to charging infrastructure and battery life

Overall sentiment and readiness to switch to electric vehicles
